# Report 1 

## Weekly Meeting Notes 
Over the past week we met several times as a group to discuss the final topic. Based on feedback from professor King, we are in the process of modifying the final topic. We plan to get more feedback from the Wednesday meeting.

## Future Goals
For the following week, we hope to resubmit our proposal and definitively decide on our topic.
